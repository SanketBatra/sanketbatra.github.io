			<p>I did my schooling from prestigious institute of ‘St. Xavier’s High School, Jamnagar’. I passed my 10th grade with distinction. I opted for Science stream I grade XII from the same school mentioned above. In which I opted Mathematics has my interest and passed XII in March 2013. Along with Math I also chose computer as one of interests where I learnt basic concepts of HTML. Which developed interest and curiosity towards computers even more.</p>
			<p>It led me to pursue my Bachelor’s in Computer Engineering from Marwadi Education Foundation affiliated by Gujarat Technological University in 2013. I learnt many concepts of C, C++, Java, ASP.net, HTML, CSS PHP, Networking, Computer graphics, DBMS and Network Security and many more. I completed my Bachelor’s of Computer engineering with 7.47 CGPA in April 2017.</p>
			<p>During my final semester, along with my final project I got exposed to business aspects of Information Technology. Which gave me curiosity to dive deeper into business aspects of IT. Because, there is way more beyond than just coding in IT field. After much thought, I decided to quit my job and planned to enhance my skills in a field related to it. After which I am here at Information Technology Business Analysis where I brushed up my SQL database knowledge, learnt elicitation techniques, managing IT projects and improvising business processes. Through which I learnt to evaluate technical and business needs and most importantly manage project requirements available for a modern Information technology industry which gave me confidence to argue if a task is appropriate fir that configuration.</p>
