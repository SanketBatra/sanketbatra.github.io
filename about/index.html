				Being an Indian I have been brought up to understand and respect people from different cultural diversities, demographics and cultural sensitivities pertaining to them. 
				 Talking about my school days, I have always been enthusiastic participant in co-curricular activities like dancing, elocution, essay writing and various sports activities.
				<p>I am Indian by origin, who underwent schooling from a reputed convent school St. Xavier’s High School and graduated as bachelor’s in computer engineering from Gujarat Technical University, one of the prestigious universities back in India. Being a Mediocre student in school to passing with distinction grade in my bachelor’s degree. I must say Journey was beautiful. Got to learn many new and interesting things in the world of computers. Recently, I am pursuing post graduate program of Information Technology Business Analysis at Conestoga College where I am molding my Information technology knowledge into business background learning interesting concepts on how to handle IT projects efficiently and successfully.
