		<div id="Why Hire me?">
			<p>As I am born and brought up in multi-cultural country like India, I have respected and regarded
diverse cultures and people since my childhood, which makes me compassionate human being
which being a prime requisite of a good employee, both for fellow colleagues as well as the
clients. My schooling in a reputed convent school has laid down foundation of perseverance,
will power and self-discipline. I accomplished my B. Tech in Computer engineering which
enhances my technical skills which are utmost necessary for the job. I have a very good grip on
MS Excel, MySQL, Gephi, Tableau etc. which is a key asset for any business analyst position. I
was amongst the few students selected for job, in the campus placement itself, before I
completed my graduation. Being served as business development associate at Think & Learn
Pvt Ltd, a leading educational company in India. I enhanced my communicational skills. I
learned about the expectations of the customers and also how to bring out the best in the
company to reach out to the demands of customers. I must say that the stress of sales, has not
only molded me for the better but also has given me an opportunity to bring out the version of
myself. Business has been a dream of mine, since I was a child. </p>
<p>Being a business analyst surely makes me apply my skills and knowledge learnt during my post graduate program at Conestoga College. If you are looking for hardworking and honest candidate than your search is over. </p>
